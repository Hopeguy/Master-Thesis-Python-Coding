Hello Joakim,

 

Thanks for sharing your report. Very nice work overall.

 

I have read your thesis report draft and I have made comments and suggestions. Please see the commented version of the file attached.

 

Some additional general comments format are the following:

?        The writing is very rough at this moment in narrative, paragraph construction and English.

o   Please double check English spelling and use grammar corrector. For instance, “an” is used only before words starting with a vowel (an optimization algorithm) otherwise always use “a” (a genetic algorithm)

o   Use more commas and keep sentences short and to the point.

o   Use more graphic material. For example, it could really improve readability if you give a list using bullet points instead of listing in the paragraph.

o   Improve the quality of pictures and flowcharts

?        I have some technical questions/doubts included in the document that I would like to ask you during a call.

?        You should include a final chart/table with the summary of the results for the reader to be able to easily compare results. This for economic results (NPV, LCOE, CAPEX) and technical (capacity, energy) something like:



 

Let’s organize a call before I go on vacation next Tuesday so we can discuss about this.

 

Best regards
