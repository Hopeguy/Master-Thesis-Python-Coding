#The plot for the fitness value is reveresed as the LCOS values are supposed to be positive but as the GA
#wants to maximize the fittness function the negative value is given in the fitness function to calculate the LCOS
#therefore the plot results in reverse and the values are supposed to be positive and the lineplot inversed.
